# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The application I am developing is a stock screener to help individuals find and choose which stocks to invest in based on their investment criteria, strategies, and goals. The application will allow users to create an account and search for stocks based on specific criteria that are traded on the major stock exchanges in the US. Users will then be able to save stocks of interest to their portfolio and track their performance over time. Users who are relatively new to active trading in the stock market will find the ability to sort by major stock categories and investment strategies useful for simplifying their research on which stocks to consider investing in. The idea came from my own small-scale investing and the difficulties in trying to decide which, of the 15,000 + stocks traded on the major exchanges, to invest in.

### Features
- User Login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application. Each user will have their own portfolio page.
- Search: Users will be able to search for stocks to add to their portfolio based on multiple criteria (e.g. stock exchange, market cap, trade volume, category).
- Portfolio: Users will be able to save stocks to their own portfolio and have multiple portfolios to track different types of stocks, if desired.
